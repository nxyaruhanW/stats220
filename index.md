## *About Assignment 1...*
Here is the meme I created for the first assignment using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).
![my_meme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101943620/159171573-e922933d-c686-4891-9d8b-69f6266c33a8.png)
### story about this meme
I made this spongebob meme with an idea came up when I was watching recordings. 

Students might feel a bit stressed out during the lectures, but wouldn't it be cool to learn how to make a meme with R Studio in class?


I chose [Spongebob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants) as the character in my meme because I just watched this animation recently.

### R code about this meme
Also, below is the `R` code I used to create my first meme in STATS 220.
```
library(magick)

#image one
tired <- image_read("https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e1e/6b7/e7e202e97398fd64f6f9b6c6d13a526234-tired-spongebob.rhorizontal.w700.jpg") %>%
  image_scale(700) %>%
  image_annotate(text = "studying in the library",
                 size = 50,
                 gravity = "south",
                 color = "#000000",
                 boxcolor = "#ffffff",
                 font = "sans")

#image two
happy <- image_read("https://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/19600000/SpongeBob-Photo-happy-square-sponge-19621591-640-360.jpg") %>%
  image_scale(700) %>%
  image_annotate(text = "making memes \n in the library",
                 size = 50,
                 gravity = "south",
                 color = "#000000",
                 boxcolor = "#ffffff",
                 font = "sans")

meme_vector <- image_append(c(tired, happy), stack = TRUE)

image_write(meme_vector, "my_meme.png")
```

Hope you like my meme and idea!!!üòä
